# 💖 Interactive Valentine's Day Invitation

A beautiful, interactive web-based invitation designed to ask that special someone: *"Will you be my Valentine?"* This project features a playful "No" button that dodges the cursor, floating heart animations, and a heartfelt surprise message upon clicking "Yes."

## ✨ Features

* **Dodging "No" Button:** The "No" button moves randomly when hovered or clicked, making it playfully difficult to decline.
* **Auto-Redirect/Force Yes:** After 5 attempts to click "No," the script automatically celebrates and accepts a "Yes" on behalf of the user.
* **Floating Hearts:** Dynamic CSS and JavaScript-powered heart balloons that float across the screen.
* **Celebration Effect:** A burst of heart emojis across the screen when the "Yes" button is clicked.
* **Responsive Design:** Works perfectly on both desktop and mobile devices.
* **Hidden Details:** A structured message reveals the date, time, and a special "Code" for a surprise gift.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Download** the `index.html` file.
2.  **Open** the file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, or Firefox).
3.  **To Personalize:** * Open the `index.html` in a text editor (like Notepad or VS Code).
    * Search for the `<div class="message-details">` section.
    * Update the Date, Time, and Location to match your specific plans.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

* **Language:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Icons:** Powered by [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
* **Styling:** Custom CSS animations (`heartbeat`, `float`, `fadeIn`).
* **Logic:** * Event listeners for `mouseover` and `click` to handle button movement.
    * DOM manipulation to generate randomized floating background elements.
